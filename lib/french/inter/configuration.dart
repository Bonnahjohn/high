    "French nouns are an important part of the French language. They are words that name people, animals, things, and ideas.In French, every noun has a gender, either masculine or feminine and it's important to use the correct article, \"le\" for masculine and \"la\" for feminine, when talking about them. For some nouns that begin with a vowel, the article \"l' \" is used instead to make it easier to say. This gender determines which article should be used before the noun. There are also singular and plural forms of both masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nHere is a table that shows some examples of French nouns and their corresponding articles:";

String nounFooter =
    "To determine the gender of a noun, there are some general rules you can follow. For example, most nouns ending in -e are feminine, while those ending in -age, -isme, and -ment are usually masculine. However, there are also many exceptions, and sometimes the gender of a noun simply needs to be memorized.\nIt's important to remember that the gender of a noun can't always be determined by its meaning, so it's helpful to learn the gender of a noun as you learn new vocabulary.\n\nKnowing French nouns is important if you want to speak and understand the French language.

    "French verbs are an essential component of the French language, and they are used to express a wide range of actions and states. Verbs in French are classified according to their endings, which are categorized into three main groups: -er, -ir, and -re. Each group has its own set of conjugation patterns that are used to express different tenses, moods, and voices \n\nThe -er verbs are the most common group and account for about 90% of all French verbs. These verbs are regular, meaning that they follow a predictable conjugation pattern. For example, the verb \"parler\" (to speak) follows the pattern of \"parler, parles, parle, parlons, parlez, parlent\" in the present tense.\n\n The -ir verbs are the second most common group and are usually regular, with the exception of a few irregular verbs like \"venir\" (to come) and \"partir\" (to leave). These verbs follow a slightly different conjugation pattern than -er verbs. For example, the verb \"finir\" (to finish) follows the pattern of \"finis, finis, finit, finissons, finissez, finissent\" in the present tense.\n\nIn addition to these three main groups, there are also a handful of verbs that are irregular in all tenses and moods, such as \"être\" (to be), \"avoir\" (to have), and \"aller\" (to go) \n\n To properly use French verbs, it's essential to understand how to conjugate them according to the tense, mood, and voice needed for the context of the sentence. French verbs have a variety of tenses, including the present, past, future, conditional, and subjunctive. Each tense has its own conjugation pattern, and it's crucial to learn these patterns to express the correct meaning.\n\nHere are some of the most popular French verbs and their conjugation in the present tense:";

Quantitative adjectives: These adjectives indicate the quantity or amount of a noun.

Demonstrative adjectives: These adjectives indicate the proximity of a noun to the speaker or the listener. For example, \"ce\" (this/that), \"cette\" (this/that), and \"ces\" (these/those). \n 4.
